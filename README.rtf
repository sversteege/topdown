\f0\fs24 \cf0 This folder contains custom made scripts I wrote for analyzing LFP data.\
I personally used the file fieldtrip_analysis_time_freq.m for my own data analysis. But, in an effort to increase readability, I wrote better code. It works as follows: there is a main file \'93example_ft_analysis.m\'94 in which you use custom-made functions. These custom-made functions in turn may use fieldtrip functions, so make sure you have them installed in the correct folder. This is all explained in the example script. So just run the example script, the rest his just function definitions.}
